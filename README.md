A Python module (with the help of coloredlogs) to add color to logs.

Still working on docs.

[Current docs](https://sclogging.readthedocs.io)

get_logger is where to get started.

Some options allow certain customizations in the records themselves (e.g. %f.red%something%f%) sets the FORE color for that word then returns to default color of that level of logging.


Other options:
Colored spacer

Easily setting seperate options for stderr and file logs

Custom timer class

  Allows this: var_a = Timer(level="INFO")
  
               var_a.start_timer(Note="I started it")
               
  Log record =  time <spacer> var_a.module.function.start_timer INFO I started it
  
  
Wraps logging, colorama.BACK, FORE, CURSOR
