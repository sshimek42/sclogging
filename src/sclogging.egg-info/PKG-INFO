A small, convenient wrapper around Python’s logging that makes it easy to:
- Bootstrap a ready-to-use logger with sensible defaults
- Optionally log to a rotating file in addition to the console
- Apply per-module/per-library log levels
- Use a simple Timer helper to measure and report elapsed time
- Centralize configuration (including colors and formatting)

The primary entry points are:
- get_logger(...) — create or retrieve a configured logger
- set_config({...}) — write a simple TOML-backed configuration
- Timer — a helper class to time code blocks and log results

Note: This README focuses on the public API and how to use it. Internal implementation details are intentionally omitted.

## Why SCLogging?

SCLogging aims to simplify common logging tasks:
- One-liner to get a ready-to-use logger
- Easy switch to also log to a file (with an auto-created directory if needed)
- Uniform formatting and colorized console output for readability
- Fine-grained control over noisy third-party libraries
- Lightweight timing utility for quick performance measurements

## Quick Start

Basic usage:
```python
# Python
from sclogging.sclogging_main import get_logger

logger = get_logger(__name__)
logger.info("Hello from SCLogging!")
logger.warning("Heads up...")
logger.error("Something went wrong.")
```


Add a timed section:
```python
# Python
from sclogging.sclogging_main import get_logger, Timer

logger = get_logger(__name__)

t = Timer(logger=logger, level="INFO")  # level is optional; INFO is a common choice
t.start_timer("Loading data")
# ... your work here ...
t.stop_timer("Loading data complete")
```


## Configuration

You can set configuration in two ways:

1) Programmatically via set_config:
```python
# Python
from sclogging.sclogging_main import set_config, get_logger

set_config({
    # Write these values into a TOML settings file used by SCLogging.
    # Typical options:
    "logging_log_to_file": True,               # Whether to also log to a file
    "logging_path": "C:\\Logs",                # Where to store log files (auto-created if enabled)
    "logging_level": "INFO",                   # Default console log level
    "logging_file_level": "WARNING",           # Default file log level
    "logging_ext": "log",                      # Log file extension (e.g., .log)
    "logging_auto_create_dir": True,           # Auto-create log directory if not present

    # Visuals
    "spacer": "_",                             # Spacer used in formatted output
    "spacer_color": "LIGHTBLACK_EX",           # Color name for spacer (console)

    # Reduce noise from third-party libraries
    "specific_loggers": {
        "urllib3": "WARNING",
        "selenium": "WARNING",
        "xhtml2pdf": "WARNING",
    },
})

logger = get_logger(__name__)
logger.info("Configured and ready!")
```


2) Via a settings file:
- SCLogging looks for a TOML-based settings file that stores the same keys shown above.
- Use set_config to generate/update this file programmatically, or manage it yourself alongside your project if preferred.

Notes:
- Log directory auto-creation is controlled by logging_auto_create_dir.
- When logging_log_to_file is True, logs will be written under logging_path with the extension logging_ext.
- Per-library overrides in specific_loggers help keep the console/file outputs tidy.

## API Overview

- get_logger(name: str, ...) -> logging.Logger
  - Returns a logger configured according to your settings. Typically called with __name__ to inherit the calling module’s name.

- set_config(config_data: dict) -> None
  - Writes configuration into the project’s SCLogging settings file (TOML). Accepts keys such as:
    - logging_log_to_file: bool
    - logging_path: str
    - logging_level: str
    - logging_file_level: str
    - logging_ext: str
    - logging_auto_create_dir: bool
    - spacer: str
    - spacer_color: str
    - specific_loggers: dict[str, str]

- class Timer(logger=None, level="INFO", ...)
  - start_timer(context: str | None = None) -> None
  - stop_timer(context: str | None = None) -> None
  - A simple timing helper. Call start_timer before the work you want to measure and stop_timer when done. If a logger is provided, timing information is logged automatically at the configured level.

Additional helpers exist internally to handle formatting, name filtering, and color output to keep logs readable.

## Practical Examples

- Minimal setup for a script:
```python
# Python
from sclogging.sclogging_main import get_logger

log = get_logger(__name__)
log.info("Starting script...")
# ... work ...
log.info("Done.")
```


- Enable file logging and tune third-party verbosity once for the whole app:
```python
# Python
from sclogging.sclogging_main import set_config, get_logger

set_config({
    "logging_log_to_file": True,
    "logging_auto_create_dir": True,
    "logging_path": "C:\\Logs",
    "logging_level": "INFO",
    "logging_file_level": "WARNING",
    "logging_ext": "log",
    "specific_loggers": {"urllib3": "WARNING", "selenium": "WARNING"},
})

app_log = get_logger("my_app")
app_log.info("Application start")
```


- Timing a function call:
```python
# Python
from sclogging.sclogging_main import get_logger, Timer

log = get_logger(__name__)

def compute():
    t = Timer(logger=log, level="INFO")
    t.start_timer("compute()")
    # heavy work here...
    t.stop_timer("compute() completed")

compute()
```


## Tips

- Use __name__ as the logger name to get a hierarchical logger corresponding to your module path.
- Lower the verbosity of noisy dependencies with specific_loggers to keep outputs focused.
- If you enable file logging, ensure logging_path is accessible and, if needed, let SCLogging create it for you via logging_auto_create_dir.
